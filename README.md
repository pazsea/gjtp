## üîî Key Functions

- **Create, login, reset/change password** All these features exists using firebase. You can also upload your own profile picture.

- **Wardrobe Component** The user gets prompted to answer a short quiz after creating an user. This will generate an recommended parfume collection for the user to subsribe to. Using redux, saga, node.js and an SQL database we fetch data and sort the parfumes to the respective collection. The user gets the correct render from the collection in which she/he has selected.

- **Rating function** Every parfume is avaible for the user to rate from 1 - 5 stars. When the user rates an parfume she/he also rates the containing notes. We have created and function that calculates the users top 5 notes.

- **Matching function** With the rating function that calculates the users top 5 notes, we also have an function that calculates which users have the most in common with the logged in user. 

- **Explore Component** We render all matching users that gets returned from the matching function with its respective wardrobes. So the logged in user can explore new parfumes.

- **Redux persist** We also use an library for persisting state on local storage. Our SQL database is static so this doesnt need to fetch all the time. Instead we fetch it once and store it on the users local storage.
