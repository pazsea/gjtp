This project works towards that goal.

## 💼 How to run this project
1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli

   ```

2. **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**

   Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

   ```sh
   # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
   gatsby new my-blazing-fast-site
   ```

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

   ```sh
   cd my-blazing-fast-site/
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-blazing-fast-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
